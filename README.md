# Mars Web Scraping Project Analysis
## Deliverable 1: Scraping Mars News
### Overview
The Mars news scraping process has provided valuable insights into recent events and discoveries related to Mars. The titles and preview text of the news articles have been successfully extracted and organized for easy access.

### Key Findings
1. <b>Number of Articles by Month:</b>
The distribution of articles across Martian months shows variations, with the highest number in March (192 articles) and the lowest in July (142 articles).

## Deliverable 2: Scraping and Analyzing Mars Weather Data
### Overview
The analysis of Mars weather data reveals important information about the climate on the Red Planet. Temperature and atmospheric pressure are examined to answer specific questions, providing a comprehensive view of Martian weather patterns.

### Key Findings
1. <b>Number of Martian Days' Worth of Data:</b>
 - The dataset contains information spanning 1867 Martian days, showcasing a substantial amount of weather data.
2. <b>Average Low Temperature by Month:</b>
 - The coldest month on Mars, on average, is the third month, while the eighth month experiences the warmest temperatures.
3. <b>Atmospheric Pressure by Month:</b>
 - Atmospheric pressure varies throughout the Martian months, with the lowest pressure observed in the sixth month and the highest in the ninth.
4. <b>Terrestrial Days in a Martian Year:</b>
   - A Mars year is approximately equivalent to 8244 Earth days, confirming the longer duration of a year on Mars.

### Data Visualization
1. <b>Average Minimum Temperature by Month:</b>
 - A bar chart visually represents the average minimum temperature for each Martian month, highlighting the temperature variations:
